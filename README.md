This prototype application is currently live and available [here](http://immense-dusk-71504.herokuapp.com)

If the website is unavailable, the application can still be run locally.
The installations of Rails and potentially PostgreSQL may be necessary.
The following tutorials can assist with this.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-installation.htm
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/tutorial-install.html

To run the application open terminal and navigate to the directory of this folder.
Once rails is installed, run the command `rake db:migrate`
Then run `rails s`
This should start the rails server.
The website will then be available at localhost:3000
